                    Hello! My name is Connor Gardiner, and I am a dedicated and passionate software engineering student with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies. I am currently a student at Centennial College, studying for an advanced diploma in software engineering technology, where I am learning JavaScript, React, Node.js, Java, C#, database concepts and various other technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on numerous projects that have allowed me to apply my knowledge and creativity to real-world scenarios. I enjoy problem-solving and am always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies to enhance my skill set.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong communicator and team player. I believe that collaboration is key to successful project outcomes, and I thrive in environments where I can work alongside others to achieve common goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not coding, I enjoy hiking, working out, and exploring new places. These hobbies help me stay creative and inspired.
                </p>
